## Introduction

daru (Data Analysis in RUby) is a library for storage, analysis, manipulation and visualization of data.

daru is inspired by pandas, a very mature solution in Python.

Written in pure Ruby so should work with all ruby implementations. Tested with MRI 2.0, 2.1, 2.2.

## Features

* Data structures:
    - Vector - A basic 1-D vector.
    - DataFrame - A 2-D spreadsheet-like structure for manipulating and storing data sets. This is daru's primary data structure.
* Compatible with [IRuby notebook](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby), [statsample](https://github.com/SciRuby/statsample) and [statsample-glm]().
* Singly and hierarchially indexed data structures.
* Flexible and intuitive API for manipulation and analysis of data.
* Easy plotting, statistics and arithmetic.
* Plentiful iterators.
* Optional speed and space optimization on MRI with [NMatrix](https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix) and GSL.
* Easy splitting, aggregation and grouping of data.
* Quickly reducing data with pivot tables for quick data summary.
* Import and exports dataset from and to Excel, CSV, Databases and plain text files.

## Roadmap

* Automate testing for both MRI and JRuby.
* Enable creation of DataFrame by only specifying an NMatrix/MDArray in initialize. Vector naming happens automatically (alphabetic) or is specified in an Array.
* Completely test all functionality for MDArray.
* Basic Data manipulation and analysis operations: 
    - DF concat
* Option to express a DataFrame as an NMatrix or MDArray so as to use more efficient storage techniques.
* Assignment of a column to a single number should set the entire column to that number.
* == between daru_vector and string/number.
* Multiple column assignment with []=
* Multiple value assignment for vectors with []=.
* #find\_max function which will evaluate a block and return the row for the value of the block is max.
* Function to check if a value of a row/vector is within a specified range.
* Create a new vector in map_rows if any of the already present rows dont match the one assigned in the block.
* Sort by index.
* Statistics on DataFrame over rows and columns.
* Cumulative sum.
* Time series support.
* Calculate percentage change.
* Have some sample data sets for users to play around with. Should be able to load these from the code itself.
* Sorting with missing data present.
* re_index should re establish previous index values in the newly supplied index.
