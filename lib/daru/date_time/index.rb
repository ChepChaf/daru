      # * 'ME'    - month end
      # * 'YS'    - year start

        #
        # For this reason, we will first take the string date, and resolve it
        # into what it is trying to say. This will be done by a function that 
        # will take in a date-like string as an input argument and output two
        # DateTime objects: the first one will denote the start of the range 
        # that the partial date-string represents and the second the end of the
        # range that the date-string represents.
        # 
        # For example, say the date-string is '2012'. This means that we're 
        # supposed to serve all the dates in the year 2012. So the string 2012
        # yields two objects, one which denotes 2012-1-1 00:00:00 and the other
        # one which denotes 2012-12-31 24:59:59. A binary search on the index
        # array can then be applied using these two objects and that will yield
        # the slice.
